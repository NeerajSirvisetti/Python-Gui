### `FileChecker` Class
- Monitors a specified folder for the existence of target files.
- It runs in a separate thread (`_monitor_folder` method) and periodically checks if the target files exist in the specified folder.
- Calls a user-provided callback (`callback`) when a target file is found.

### `ApicGui` Class

- Divides the main window into two sections: Section 1 and Section 2.

#### Section 1
- Contains multiple frames (`r1`, `r2`, `r3`, `r4`) for organizing widgets.

- Provides a Combobox for selecting a step, along with buttons for running, stopping, and refreshing.

- Initializes a `FileChecker` instance to monitor a specified folder for steps and updates the GUI when steps are completed.
